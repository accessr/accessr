      <section>
        <p>Accessibility isn’t just about meeting technical standards — it’s about ensuring that everyone can read, understand, and use information that affects their lives. When government communications are accessible, they uphold transparency, equality, and public trust.</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p><strong>Inaccessible communication excludes citizens.</strong> It limits access to essential services, legal rights, and public information — all of which governments are required to make available to everyone.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Accessibility is a legal and ethical responsibility</h2>
        <p>Across Australia and internationally, accessibility in public communication is a legal requirement. In Australia, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> are mandated under the <em>Disability Discrimination Act 1992</em>.  
        This applies not only to websites but also to downloadable documents such as Word and PDF files. When a government agency posts an inaccessible report, it may be in breach of federal law.</p>

        <h2>2. Accessible content improves clarity for everyone</h2>
        <p>Good accessibility equals good communication. Features like clear headings, structured tables, descriptive links, and alt text make content easier to scan and understand — even for readers who aren’t using assistive technology.  
        Plain language, readable formatting, and consistent structure benefit everyone from policy experts to the general public.</p>

        <h2>3. Accessibility builds trust and transparency</h2>
        <p>Governments communicate to serve the public. Citizens expect that vital information — from health updates to infrastructure plans — will be presented clearly and equitably. Accessibility reinforces trust by ensuring that no group is unintentionally excluded.  
        It also demonstrates responsible stewardship of taxpayer resources: an accessible document serves more people and avoids costly rework later.</p>

        <h2>4. Common accessibility issues in government documents</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Using visual formatting (bold, colour) instead of real heading styles.</li>
          <li>Images without alt text or captions describing their purpose.</li>
          <li>Tables missing header rows or cell relationships.</li>
          <li>Links that read “click here” instead of meaningful text.</li>
          <li>Unlabeled charts or diagrams with key information locked in images.</li>
        </ul>
